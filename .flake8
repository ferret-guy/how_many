# Exceptions from the default Flake8 rules:
# - E203: required for compatibility with Black's slice formatting.
# - E701: kept to allow Black's preferred guard-clause layout when it produces
#   an inline ``return`` after an ``if``.
# - D100-D107: most public classes, methods, and functions are exercised through
#   GUI interactions, and requiring docstrings everywhere would add noise
#   without improving clarity.
# - D200, D202, D205: existing multi-line docstrings follow NumPy-style
#   formatting that intentionally includes blank-line separation.
# - D401: we allow narrative-style summaries when they better describe the
#   behaviour of helper routines.
